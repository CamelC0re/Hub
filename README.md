# CamelCore Hub

Welcome to the **CamelCore Hub**, the official central directory and plugin submission platform for CamelCore (a RuneLite-esque client for EvilQuest). This monorepo powers both the public-facing frontend directory and the robust backend API handling plugin lifecycle management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This repository is structured as a Yarn monorepo containing two main packages:

### `@camelcore/web` (Frontend)
Located in `packages/web`, the frontend is built using **Astro** for lightning-fast static and dynamic rendering, paired with **Svelte** for highly interactive components. It features a bespoke retro dark fantasy design aesthetic tailored to match EvilQuest's immersive world.

Key Features:
- **Public Plugin Directory:** Browse all officially approved CamelCore plugins.
- **Developer Dashboard:** Authenticated developers can submit new plugins and sync remote repository updates.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can review, approve, or reject pending plugin submissions from the community.

### `@camelcore/api` (Backend)
Located in `packages/api`, the backend is a serverless application built on **Cloudflare Workers**. It acts as the secure bridge between the frontend application, our database, and external integrations.

Key Features:
- **Plugin Lifecycle Management:** Handles the submission queue, admin approvals/rejections, and version syncing.
- **GitHub Integrations:** Uses GitHub OAuth for secure user authentication. It also automatically dispatches webhook events to the `CamelC0re/Plugin-Builder` repository to compile and bundle submitted plugins.
- **Cloudflare R2 Storage:** Manages the staging and storage of plugin source code (`.zip` files) downloaded from user repositories.
- **Cloudflare D1 Database:** Persists user data, plugin metadata, and submission queues globally at the edge.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v4.x)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for Cloudflare local development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CamelC0re/Hub.git
   cd Hub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running Locally

You can run both the frontend web app and the backend API server concurrently using the root package scripts:

- **Start the API Server (Cloudflare Worker Local Emulator):**
  ```bash
  yarn api
  ```
  *The backend will run on `http://localhost:8787`.*

- **Start the Web Frontend:**
  ```bash
  yarn web
  ```
  *The frontend will run on `http://localhost:4321`.*

## 🔒 Environment Variables

To run the full stack locally, you'll need the appropriate `.env` or `.dev.vars` files configured in your workspaces.

**Backend (`packages/api/.dev.vars`):**
Requires GitHub OAuth client credentials, database bindings, and R2 storage bucket configurations.

**Frontend (`packages/web/.env`):**
Requires the public API URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8787` in development) and any public-facing OAuth keys.
